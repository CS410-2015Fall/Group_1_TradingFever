TradingFever

Description: Project for UBC Advanced Software Engineering

Details: we wanted to make an educational and fun stock trading and investing simulation game, hence TradingFever. 
In this game, you will learn what it's like to have a real stock trading account (with real life metrics), in a 
simulated trading environment. By trading well, you can make money and progress in the game. Active trading profits are enhanced by passive income from more long term investments on the investment page, should you choose to do so. These 
investments are not just easy money, however, and carry their own risks (even up to incarceration!). Random events 
will fire when you invest, and will reference real life events (in fact, most of them are real events involving real 
people with their names slightly altered). If you feel like you made a ton of money, you can look at where you stand 
on the leaderboard, where you can check out who the top players are. This leaderboard is not real time, so your score 
may reflect what you had an hour ago. Throughout the game, you are accompanied by your trusty IA (investment advisor) 
Kato, who will educate you on terms and give you investment advice. You can check your net worth by clicking your 
avatar (where you can also take a selfie to use as your avatar photo). 

Implementation: we used the Cordova/Phonegap framework to develop mobile apps using javascript/html/css. We 
have used various resources such as jquery, bootstrap, the mobile camera, jasmine for testing, etc (for a comprehensive list, look at the js libraries included in index.html).

Special thanks to DJ Taro for providing us with a sweet soundtrack!
